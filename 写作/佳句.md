## 佳句

1. An average data scientist deals with loads of data daily. Some say over 60-70% time is spent in data cleaning, munging (微调) and bringing data to a suitable format such that machine learning models can be applied on that data. This post focuses on the second part, i.e., applying machine learning models, including the preprocessing steps. The pipelines discussed in this post come as a result of over a hundred machine learning competitions that I’ve taken part in. It must be noted that the discussion here is very general but very useful and there can also be very complicated methods which exist and are practised by professionals.
2. Before applying the machine learning models, the data must be converted to a tabular (表格) form. This whole process is the most time consuming and difficult process and is depicted (描绘) in the figure below.
